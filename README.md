# JAWS - Just Another Windows (Enum) Script

JAWS is PowerShell script designed to help penetration testers (and CTFers) quickly identify potential privilege escalation vectors on Windows systems. It is written using PowerShell 2.0 so 'should' run on every Windows version since Windows 7.

## Usage:


**Run from within CMD shell and write out to file.**
```
CMD C:\temp> powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFilename JAWS-Enum.txt
```
**Run from within CMD shell and write out to screen.**
```
CMD C:\temp> powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\jaws-enum.ps1
```
**Run from within PS Shell and write out to file.**
```
PS C:\temp> .\jaws-enum.ps1 -OutputFileName Jaws-Enum.txt
```
